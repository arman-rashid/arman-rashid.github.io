        <p class="u-align-justify u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-text u-text-2"> Nanoscale Molecular Junctions – An Electrochemical ApproachInstrumentation and methodology development</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-text u-text-3"> The field of molecular electronics aims at constructing a detailed knowledge base of the physico-chemical properties of single molecule-based junctions and the mechanistic behind the single (or ensemble) charge/heat transport. Such knowledge is the key to design the next generation of hybrid electronic high-perform​ance devices for a wide variety of applications in organic electronics, sensing, optoelectronics, bio-manufacturing etc. A consensus on how structural and conformational parameters affect the charge transport, and vice versa, has not yet been reached in the scientific community, but is strongly desirable because of the imminent potential of single(or ensemble) molecular junctions as the prototype building block for functional materials and molecular electronic devices. The aim of my research work is to contribute to that knowledge..The main aim of our Research is to develop necessary instrumentation and explore the electronic, thermal and thermoelectric properties in metal (or carbon) │molecule│metal (or carbon) and metal (or carbon) │SAM│metal (or carbon) junctions employing a nanoscale electrochemical measurement approach. By studying the electronic properties at various level of complexity from single molecule to single cell, Structure property relationships can be established, Using established structure property relations, we will finally explore the ways in which these relations can be translated to the real-world applications and will help to solve the unwound mysteries of the nature. We are trying to reveal how atomic-detailed nano-scaled structural modification in molecules can affect the performance, energy consumption and longevity of molecular-scale devices. In terms of the practical point of view, our Research holds a great the promise of developing flexible, lightweight, solution-processable, and low-cost molecular devicesWe are employing the following topology for a molecular junction: A central functional unit (F) is attached via spacer units (S) and anchoring groups (A), either symmetrically (A-S-F-S-A) or asymmetrically (A-S-F-S) to contacting electrodes. The latter are represented either by the tip of an STM or CP-AFM or EGaIn top electrode and an adsorbate-modified single-crystal metal substrate or a pair of nanoelectrodes in a fixed or variable (mechanically controlled break junction, MCBJ) geometry. We are trying to evaluate how the charge transport through single molecules and hybrid assemblies is modulated by external stimuli. Also exploring the conductance switching phenomena via electric field control, redox control and/or with light-responsive molecules. The main motive is at establishing fundamental aspects of electron transport and thermoelectric properties as well as relationships between structural-functionality of nanoscale molecular junctions and their electronic response upon electrochemical and/or light stimulation, pH change etc. at the single-molecule or ensemble level. Application studies towards molecular recognition like Sensing(inorganic and bio)are anticipated.It should eventually be possible to expand our knowledge of molecular electronics into high-throughput printed nano-electronic technology.</p>
